# ChaosFractal

It was my first finished project in Unity. It was made at the beginning of second course for the "Week of Science" conference in Polytech. The task was to learn about the way of generating fractals by random recurrent Affine transformation. I made programm which draw this step by step. The code is very dirty because at that time I didn't know Unity very well and learn it via programming this project.
